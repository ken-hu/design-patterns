# Intent
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

# Structure
Facade 'wraps' all the classes in a subsystem, the intention is to provide a eaiser interface to most clients without hiding the interfaces in the subsystem completely. While Adapter is to hide an existing class and 'convert' the interface to what the client expects and integrate into the current system.
